# About

This tool does not manipulate the game files. It works via 'Config.ini' but creates a backup copy of NostaleX-File. Check out the settings-menu for more information.

It also comes with "Autologin" which is a feature that stores your credentials and automatically sends these keystrokes to the game client, so you wont have to enter it each time.

# Installation

You just have to copy this launcher into your Nostale-Folder and run it.
